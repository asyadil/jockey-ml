# An AI Jockey Service for Mobile Legends (ML)

This project is an AI-based service designed to provide **AI bot jockeying** for **Mobile Legends (ML)**. The goal is to create an efficient and intelligent AI model that can play the game and help users rank up without having to play the game manually.

## Concept

In popular online multiplayer games like **Mobile Legends (ML)**, many people work as *jockeys*, using their skills to help others rank up. However, instead of hiring human players, this project uses **AI bots** to automatically play the game on behalf of the user. The AI models are designed to be **efficient**, **intelligent**, and capable of climbing ranks **quickly** and **strategically**.

The main features of this AI system are:

- **AI Teams (5v5)**: The game requires a 5-player team. All five players in the team will be AI bots. The bots need to work together, using good coordination and strategy to win.
  
- **Efficient Ranking**: The AI bots are designed to win consistently and quickly climb the rank ladder without losing, ensuring the most efficient ranking process.

- **Team Coordination**: The bots are programmed to communicate and cooperate as a team, ensuring smooth gameplay and strategic decision-making.
  
- **Strategy & Performance**: The AI learns and adapts to different in-game situations, ensuring it can execute strategies, such as when to attack, retreat, or support teammates.

## How It Works

1. **AI Training**: The AI models will be trained using data from various Mobile Legends matches, analyzing different scenarios and decision-making processes from top-tier players.
  
2. **Multi-Agent System**: Each bot in the team will communicate with others in real-time, creating a well-coordinated and efficient team.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The AI bots will utilize reinforcement learning to improve their decision-making abilities based on past experiences and outcomes, ensuring continuous improvement.

4. **Efficient Performance**: The system aims to optimize performance, making sure the AI plays in the most efficient and effective way possible to increase rank.

## Future Improvements

- **Better Team Coordination**: Further improving the interaction between bots, making sure they can communicate even more effectively and perform well under different situations.
  
- **Advanced Strategy Development**: Adding more complex strategies to handle various playstyles and counter strategies against human players.

- **User Customization**: Allowing users to customize the AI's gameplay preferences, such as aggressive play, defensive play, or support roles.

## Notes

- **Testing & Optimization**: The system is still in development and will require ongoing testing and optimization to ensure high-level performance in actual matches.
